    <h1>Happy Anniversary, Bumbum!! 💖</h1>
    <p>I wanted to give you a gift that could possibly last from the 26th to the 8th so it doesn't matter which one we count as the official anniversary...soooo here is your surprise adventure around Asia! This map is filled with clues from our favorite travels. Solve each "puzzle" by finding and clicking the correct location on the map. When you're right, you'll unlock a memory—and maybe a surprise or two. 👀</p>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
      <li>Click on the map pins to explore.</li>
      <li>Use the clues and hints to find each location.</li>
      <li>Zoom, pan, and even switch to satellite view for a better look!</li>
      <li>Some ❓ pins are there to help, but only one is the answer.</li>
      <li>Complete all 30 clues to unlock your final bonus surprise!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can save and continue later without losing your progress, just open the link back up again 🙂. There's also a button if you want to reset and start over. I hope you have fun and remember I love you bbbbyyyy 😍 🤗 🍕</p>
